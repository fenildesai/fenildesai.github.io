- Honesty in small things is not a small thing. God is in the details.

- Making your code readable is as important as making it executable.

- Concept of Total Productive Maintenance (TMP) - 5s Principles:

* **Seiri: Organising** - Knowing where things are: naming is crucial.
* **Seiton: Tidiness** - A piece of code should be where you expect to find it.
* **Seiso: Cleaning** - Keep the workplace free of unuseful things (comments, etc).
* **Seiketsu: Standardization** - The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean.
* **Shutsuke: Self Discipline** - Follow the practices.

- You should name a variable using the same care with which you name a first born child.

- A bad penny always shows up.

- Quality is a result of a million selfless acts of care - not just of any great method that descends from the heaven.

- The code is the design & Simple code are their mantras.

- Code is anti-evil and clean code is perhans divine.

- Don't just pay attention to small things, but be honest in small things.

- Honest to code, honest about the state of our code.

- Neither architecture nor clean code insists on perfection, but only on honesty & doing the best we can. To err is human, to forgive is divine.

- If a clean shop floor reduces accidents & a well organised shop tools increase productivity, then I am all for them.

- Leave the campground/world, a little cleaner/better then we found it.
